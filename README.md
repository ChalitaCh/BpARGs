#  Antibiotic resistance genes analyses in *Burkholderia pseudomallei*

This repository is for the analyses of Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs) evolutionary dynamics in *B. pseudomallei* using a global collection of the bacteria 3,341 whole-genome sequences from the public databases. This project is part of the MSc Computational methods in ecology and evolution at Imperial College London.

## Description

This project aims to identify both novel and characterised ARGs, and the prevalence of resistant variants in a global population of *B. pseudomallei*. Furthermore, I hope to disentangle how the resistance genes and variants bring about, and their association to human activities such as antibiotic treatment in clinical settings. This project utilised the combination of R and shell script in the analyses. The directories are listed as; data, code, results, and sandbox.
